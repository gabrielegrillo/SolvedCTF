Go to in the directory: /problems/grep-2_0_783d3e2c8ea2ebd3799ca6a5d28fc742/files
(use ssh via your terminal and not from the webshell) 

As we can see there are a lot of files...
and we can't use a single grep command.

But there's a option for use grep recursively.

"grep -R picoCTF"

output: "files5/file23:picoCTF{grep_r_and_you_will_find_24c911ab}"
in the folder "files5"
       file "file23" 
there's the flag "picoCTF{grep_r_and_you_will_find_24c911ab}"
